# ☕️ The Cafe ☕️

This is a Rails application that was given as an assignment from The Flatiron School during Mod 2. My goal was to create a functioning CRUD application that followed RESTful conventions. The Cafe is an application that can connect an exisiting/new customer to a drink. Customers are able to see their drinks as well as create new orders. Inspiration credit to Tess! 

Tools Used:

* Rails

* ActiveRecord

* Ruby

## How to Run

1. `git clone` this respository into your computer.
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Finally, type `rails s` to create a local server.
4. Copying and paste the section past `Listening on tcp://` on to your browser.
  * Should look like something like this `localhost:3000`.
5. In your browser, start at `/welcome` to access the welcome page. 
6. Enjoy ordering drinks from The Cafe! ☕️
